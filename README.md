![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/099a8313-5e86-4cd3-b897-d8e327fa2ad7)

1. Write Task: Adds a new task to the list if the input box is not empty.
2. Check/Uncheck Task: Toggles the completion status of a task when clicked.
3. Delete Task: Removes a task from the list when the associated delete button is clicked.
4. Save and Load Data: Tasks are automatically saved in the browser's local storage, and they are loaded back when the app is opened.
